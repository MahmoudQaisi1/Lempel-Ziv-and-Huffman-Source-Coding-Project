# Lempel-Ziv vs. Huffman Encoding Comparison Project

## Description

This Python project explores and compares two widely used data compression techniques: Lempel-Ziv and Huffman encoding. The primary objective is to analyze their efficiency in compressing data and to determine the number of binary digits and bits required for each technique.

**Key Components and Processes:**

1. **Random Symbol Sequence Generation:**
   - The project begins by generating a random symbol sequence with assigned probabilities. This sequence simulates real-world data and serves as the input for compression.

2. **Lempel-Ziv Encoding:**
   - Lempel-Ziv encoding is implemented using Python's built-in modules and straightforward sequence handling. The project examines how Lempel-Ziv encodes the symbol sequence and calculates the resulting compressed size.

3. **Huffman Encoding:**
   - Python libraries are utilized to create parsing software and generate Huffman codes for the symbol sequence. The project analyzes Huffman encoding's efficiency and compression capabilities.

4. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - The project evaluates and compares the performance and effectiveness of Lempel-Ziv and Huffman encoding techniques. This evaluation includes calculating compression ratios relative to the uncompressed ASCII code representation of the symbol sequence.

**Purpose and Significance:**

Data compression techniques are crucial in various applications, including data storage and transmission. By comparing Lempel-Ziv and Huffman encoding, this project aims to provide insights into which technique is more suitable for different types of data. It also serves as a learning exercise in implementing and analyzing data compression algorithms using Python.

**Outcome:**

The project will produce valuable insights into the compression capabilities of Lempel-Ziv and Huffman encoding techniques. Researchers and developers can gain a better understanding of when and how to apply each technique based on their specific compression needs.

This project demonstrates practical usage of Python's built-in modules and libraries in the context of data compression and serves as an educational resource for those interested in data compression algorithms.
